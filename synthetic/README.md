Please note that these synthetic datasets will not produce the same results as the original datasets. They have been created as example files to run the analysis scripts provided under [code](../code) (starting with scripts '02_bayesian_analysis.R'). The original data are available on request from the corresponding author. The data are not publicly available due to them containing information that could compromise research participant privacy/consent.
